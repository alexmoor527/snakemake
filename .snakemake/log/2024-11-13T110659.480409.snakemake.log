MissingOutputException in rule run_all_script in file /home/alex/Masters/Computer_and_Software_Architecture/Snakemake_Project/Snakefile, line 5:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
structure_image.png (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
