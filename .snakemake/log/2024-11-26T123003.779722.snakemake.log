Error in rule download_input_file:
    jobid: 2
    output: data/input.sdf
    shell:
        
        wget https://example.com/path/to/input.sdf -O data/input.sdf
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job download_input_file since they might be corrupted:
data/input.sdf
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
